# Getting Started with Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world's most popular markup languages.

## Why Use Markdown?

- **Easy to Learn**: The syntax is straightforward and intuitive
- **Platform Independent**: Can be used anywhere
- **Future Proof**: Being plain text, it will always be readable
- **Versatile**: Can be converted to HTML, PDF, and other formats

## Basic Syntax

Here are some basic formatting options:

### Headers

Use `#` for headers. More `#` means smaller headers.

### Emphasis

- *Italics* using `*asterisks*`
- **Bold** using `**double asterisks**`

### Lists

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

Or unordered:

- First point
- Second point
- Third point

### Code

Use backticks for `inline code` or triple backticks for code blocks:

```
function hello() {
    console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```
